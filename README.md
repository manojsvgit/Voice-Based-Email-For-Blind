# Voice-Based Email for the Blind Using Python

This project provides a voice-enabled email system for visually impaired users, allowing them to send and receive emails using speech. Built with Python, the system uses text-to-speech (TTS) and speech recognition technologies to interact with users and perform essential email functions like composing, sending, and checking inbox messages.

## Features
- **Voice Interaction**: Users can compose and send emails through voice commands.
- **Inbox Management**: Users can listen to details of received emails, including sender, subject, and body content.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text for composing and interacting with email functions.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: Reads out system prompts, email contents, and feedback to users.

## Key Libraries
- `SpeechRecognition`: For recognizing spoken input.
- `gTTS`: Google's Text-to-Speech for converting text into spoken words.
- `pyglet`: For playing audio files generated by TTS.
- `smtplib` and `imaplib`: For sending and receiving emails via Gmail.
- `BeautifulSoup`: For parsing and reading email contents.

## How It Works
1. The system greets the user and asks for their name.
2. It then prompts the user to either compose a new email or check their inbox.
3. Based on the user's voice commands, the system will either:
   - Guide them through sending an email, or
   - Read out details of new/unread emails from their inbox.

### Sending Emails
- Users can speak the recipient's email and message body.
- The system uses `smtplib` to authenticate and send the email via Gmail's SMTP server.

### Checking Inbox
- Users can request details about their inbox, including the number of unseen emails.
- The system fetches email metadata (e.g., sender, subject) and reads it out loud using TTS.
- Email content is fetched and parsed using `BeautifulSoup` to strip out HTML elements for better readability.

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install gTTS
pip install pyglet
pip install beautifulsoup4
